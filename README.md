# PlanIt - Daily productivity planner - Frontend

## About this project

The *Daily productivity planner* is a web application designed to help you take full control of your day. It combines three powerful tools to keep you organized, focused, and flexible:

- *Structured daily scheduler:*  
  Plan your daily activities by assigning specific start and end times. View your schedule in a clear, chronological layout that helps you spot overlaps and open slots, so you can adjust your plans easily.

- *Flexible to-do list:*  
  Manage important tasks that donâ€™t need a fixed time. Mark tasks as high priority, check them off when completed, and keep your task list organized separately from your scheduled activities.

- *Daily notes:*  
  Capture thoughts, reminders, ideas, or any information you want to remember for the day. Write freely and format your notes simply to keep them clear and easy to review.
